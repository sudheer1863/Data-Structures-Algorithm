# Data Structures & Algorithms 📚⚡  

Welcome! 👋  

This repository contains my implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
The goal is to practice problem-solving and build a solid foundation for coding interviews and competitive programming.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- `Arrays/` → Basic operations, searching, sorting  
- `Strings/` → Manipulation, pattern matching  
- `LinkedList/` → Singly, Doubly, and Circular linked lists  
- `Stacks/` → Array & LinkedList implementations, applications  
- `Queues/` → Simple, Circular, Priority, and Deque implementations  
- `Trees/` → Binary Trees, BST, Traversals, Heap, Trie  
- `Graphs/` → BFS, DFS, Shortest Path, MST algorithms  
- `Recursion/` → Backtracking, Divide & Conquer problems  
- `DynamicProgramming/` → Classic DP problems and optimizations  
- `Greedy/` → Greedy algorithms and applications  
- `Sorting/` → Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap sort, etc.  
- `Searching/` → Linear, Binary, Advanced searching techniques  

## 🎯 Purpose  
- Strengthen **problem-solving skills**.  
- Build a reference of **DSA implementations** in code.  
- Prepare for **technical interviews & competitive programming**.  

## ⚠️ Note  
All solutions are implemented from scratch for **learning purposes**.  
Each folder contains code files related to that specific topic.  

## 💡 Contribution  
If you’d like to suggest optimized solutions or add new DSA problems, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
